## A Mood Light That *Sees* Wi-Fi Signals

We‚Äôre all familiar with the blinking LEDs on computers and router Ethernet ports ‚Äî seemingly random, and no one really pays attention. But what about wireless Wi-Fi signals? Could we create a similar kind of "signal light" for them?

So I DIYed a Wi-Fi sniffer and used code and algorithms to visualize the captured data, turning it into a real-time ambient light that reacts to Wi-Fi signals.
